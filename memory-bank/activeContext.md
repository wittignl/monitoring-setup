## Next Steps

### 1. Implementation
- [x] Create main installation script
- [x] Develop configuration templates
- [x] Implement service management
- [x] Implement Multipass manual testing

Current implementation status:
1. Main installation script (main.sh) completed with:
   - OS detection and dependency management
   - Service user creation
   - Component installation orchestration
   - Error handling and logging

2. Installation modules created for:
   - Grafana (v10.4.2)
   - Prometheus (v3.1.0)
   - Node Exporter (v1.8.2)
   - MySQL Exporter (v0.16.0)
   - Blackbox Exporter (v0.25.0)
   - PM2 Exporter
   - Duplicati Exporter

### 2. Configuration
- [x] Prepare Grafana provisioning
- [x] Configure Prometheus scraping
- [x] Set up exporter configurations
- [x] Implement alert rules

Configuration status:
1. Grafana:
   - Provisioning setup for datasources and dashboards
   - Mattermost notification channel
   - Alert rule provisioning
   - Service management

2. Prometheus:
   - Unified configuration management
   - Scraping configuration for all exporters
   - Service configuration
   - Storage retention settings

3. Exporters:
   - Node Exporter: System metrics collection
   - MySQL Exporter: Database monitoring
   - Blackbox Exporter: SSL and endpoint monitoring
   - PM2 Exporter: Process monitoring
   - Duplicati Exporter: Backup monitoring


## Active Decisions

### 1. Installation Strategy
- Using package managers as primary installation method
- Fallback to binary installations when needed
- Creating dedicated service users
- Implementing systematic dependency checks

### 2. Configuration Management
- Single source of truth for configurations
- Version-controlled configuration files
- Template-based provisioning
- Environment variable support

### 3. Service Management
- Using systemd for service control
- Implementing automatic service registration
- Creating service dependencies
- Managing service permissions

### 4. Monitoring Strategy
- Local monitoring stack per server
- Standardized metric collection
- Unified dashboard templates
- Centralized alert management


## Current Considerations

### 1. Security
- Service user permissions
- Endpoint protection
- Configuration security
- Update mechanisms

### 2. Scalability
- Metric retention (15d default)
- Resource utilization
- Configuration distribution
- Update management

### 3. Maintenance
- Backup monitoring (Duplicati)
- Update processes
- Configuration management
- Service monitoring

### 4. Documentation
- Installation guides
- Configuration references
- Troubleshooting guides
- Maintenance procedures
